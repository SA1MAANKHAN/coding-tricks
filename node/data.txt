Now, how do we relate all of this to the blockchain? Fungible tokens on the blockchain are called ERC-20 tokens. This ERC-20 is a standard format created by the Ethereum Foundation that is used to define a token. Many popular tokens have been created, like Tether (USDt), Bitcoin (BTC), BitTorrent Token (BTT), and many more.

These tokens are virtual currencies that can be traded just like real currencies. You can trade a real-world item like cars, land, or other goods and be paid in any of the tokens.

NFTs are created using the ERC-721 standard, which recognizes ownership. This ERC-721 is used to store ownership of collectibles in the blockchain. These collectibles can be anything, like deeds of ownership, houses, pieces of art, and so on.

Images, and more specifically digital art pieces, are popular collectibles NFTs because they are easy to store, share, and sell.
